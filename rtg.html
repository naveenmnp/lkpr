        <h3 aline=left>MODUS OPERANDI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Operating a textile showroom requires more manpower and needs to be constantly updated about the current fashion trends. As THE RTG SILK is one of the biggest silk saree destinations in south Tamilnadu, we decided to highlight its feature</p></li>
            <li><p>We formulated an online campaign for Rajayoga pattu, an exclusive bridal collection of THE RTG SILK. It has successfully going on till now</p></li>
            <li><p>Apart from this, we've designed online campaigns to promote sales by extensively marketing the shop. The executed campaigns are as Follows Aadi campaign 2022 | Diwali campaign 2022</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>RTG Campaign by LKPR</h3>
        <h4 aline = left>DIWALI CAMPAIGN</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Diwali is an important day for every Hindu apart from Hindus, it is celebrated by all people across India. It seemed an excellent opportunity to execute our campaign since all people will buy new clothes for this festival.
                    RIG We've devised an online and offline contest to interact with many people and also able to advertise the new collections of THE RTG SILK</p></li>
            <li><p>From this campaign, we've been able to reach many people
                and also increased the online audience to earlier days,
                many people eagerly participated and some people even
                suggested their ideas to help our campaign.</p></li>
             <li><p>Overall, it is a great success with many people asking about our next campaign.</p></li>   
        </ul>
        <h4 aline = left>AADI CAMPAIGN</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We make use of the opportunity of Aadi month sales to easily promote THE RTG SILK with the help of social media and collateral distribution RTG</p></li>    
            <li><p>We've designed a tagline for this aadi campaign in Tamil called" RTG which is exactly apt as THE RTG SILK unlike any textile showroom, stacks new products for people rather than make people buy cheap knock off</p></li>
            <li><p>To promote online traffic, We've formulated a three-step Instagram contest for THE RTG SILK specifically to boost Aadi sales. It helps people more aware of the establishment and also able to achieve a good impression of THE RTG SILK</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 aline="left">RAJAYOGA PATTU CAMPAIGN</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>It is the Opulent silk saree collection of THE RTG SILK specially designed and sewn as a Bridal saree .As we've searched for a unique characteristic of THE RTG SILK, it struck us, as an obvious and inevitable choice</p></li>
            <li><p>We've suggested that Rajayoga Pattu should be marketed as it will effectively reach people because, there is not even a single-dedicated retail outlet only for the bridal saree collection in southern Tamilnadu</p></li>
            <li><p>Branding the Rajayoga pattu is very easy, because of its fine quality silk blended with magnificent colors, awe-struck designs, intricate patterns, and a rich zari</p></li>
        </ul>
       <h4 aline = lest>SOCIAL MEDIA PROMOTIONS</h4>
       <ul>
            <li><p> The conventional method of advertising is still effective to some extent, but it'll not meet the expected results that we want to achieve</p></li>
            <li><p> when it comes to marketing bridal sarees, the class and richness can't be conveyed easily. It should be constantly updated to the people to make the brand more recognizable and reliable</p></li>
            <li><p>In this digital age, even shopping is done online, so the digital presence of clothing outlets is an inevitable one, nowadays. So we've agreed not only to make a social media presence for THE RTG SILK but to actively market and advertise the shop and the rich quality of the dresses it has</p></li>
